# Building HTW Berlin Web Components

The [**npm package** `htw-berlin-ds-webcomponents`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/htw-berlin-ds-webcomponents) distributes the HTW Berlin Web Components to developers.
The Web Components have been built using a small compiler called [stencil.js](https://stenciljs.com/).

## Stencil

_Stencil takes TypeScript, JSX, a tiny virtual DOM layer, efficient one-way data binding, an asynchronous rendering pipeline (similar to React Fiber), and lazy-loading out of the box, and generates 100% standards-based Web Components that run in any browser supporting the Custom Elements v1 spec._

_Stencil components are just Web Components, so they work in any major framework or with no framework at all._

## Adding a new HTW Berlin Web Component

If you wish to extend the package with your own htw-berlin-component start by cloning its [htw-ds-webcomponents development repo](https://github.com/kevinklaus/htw-ds-webcomponents).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevinklaus/htw-ds-webcomponents.git
```

then run:

```bash
npm install
```

To generate a new component template run:

```bash
npm run generate
```

**Name your component with the prefix `htw-berlin-`**

To serve stecils index.html for component testing run

```bash
npm start
```

To build the components for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Adding components to the [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/web-components/get-started/introduction)

Read the [Writing Stories section of the Storybook docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/web-components/writing-stories/introduction) to learn how to create a new story for your web component.
**You will not need to import the htw-berlin-webcomponents** since they are already globally availiable in your storybook after running `npm run build`.

To serve the storybook with the web component stories locally run

```bash
npm run storybook
```

To build a static Storybook for production, run:

```bash
npm run build-storybook
```
