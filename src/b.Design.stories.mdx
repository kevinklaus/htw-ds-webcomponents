# HTW Berlin Design System

An important part of the HTW Berlin Design System is its Design Asset implementation.

## Design Assets

Each Web Component in this Storybook is linked to its respective Design implementaion in Figma.
You can find it under the components' Canvas in the tab Design next to the Controls.
This way you can immediately compare the Design with the Front-End implementation of a component.

## Wireframes for Prototyping

All HTW Berlin Design Assets/Wireframes can be viewed on Figma: [HTW Berlin Design System - Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/3G68UamepjyuhaTgi6knvD/HTW-Berlin-Design-System?node-id=178%3A82).
Figma can be used for wireframing and prototyping. The Design Assets can and should be used to **build interactive high-fidelity prototypes for user testing**.
The design implementations of the HTW Berlin Web Components are structured in alignment to the Components in this Storybook.
