# HTW Berlin Design System

The HTW Berlin Design System is built using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/web-components/get-started/introduction) a User Interface explorer and development platform for stand-alone UI components.
It includes a range of User Interface elements that can be used to build Web Applications with a [HTW Berlin Corporate Identity](https://corporatedesign.htw-berlin.de/).

## Component Library

**Browse example component stories by navigating to them in the sidebar.** The Canvas Tab can be used to view the components in isolation.
The components are grouped into Atoms, Molecules, Organisms and Templates following the [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/table-of-contents/) approach by Brad Frost.

#### Atoms üü¢

Atoms are the least complex components like the most basic building blocks or variables of user interfaces. This could be things like [Typography](../?path=/story/design-system-atoms-typography--typography) and [Colors](../?path=/story/design-system-atoms-colors--page).

#### Molecules üß¨

Molecules are simple stand alone user interface elements like [Avatars](../?path=/story/design-system-molecules-avatar--avatar), [Buttons](../?path=/story/design-system-molecules-button--button), [Links](../?path=/story/design-system-molecules-link--link) etc.

#### Organisms üåê

Organisms are component combinations that offer over more complex functionality to users. This could be Navigation elements like Menus or other common features. For example [Top Menu](../?path=/story/design-system-organisms-top-menu--extended-standard) and [Chat](../?path=/story/design-system-organisms-chat--chat)

#### Templates üñ•

Templates are the most complex components. They include skeletons of full user interfaces composed of many individual components e.g. an entire [Application Page](../?path=/story/design-system-pages-application-page--application-page).

## Viewing different States, Variants & Colors

Use the fields below the Canvas to edit the properties of components to dynamically update their values.

## Documentation

Each component's documentation can be viewed in its **Docs tab**. You will find information on how they work along with **best practices** for their usage.
