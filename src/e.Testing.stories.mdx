# Testing HTW Berlin Web Components

Storybook allows us to test and develop components in isolation.

## States, Variants & Colors

Each HTW Berlin Web Component may come in differnet shapes, sizes and colors, which can make testing complex.
Use the **Controls** below the Canvas to edit the properties of components to **dynamically update attribute values**.
The componet will auto-update in the Canvas so that you can **immediately see your changes applied**.

## Dark Mode

HTW Berlin Web Components offer support for dark mode styling. Apply the dark mode style by setting the `dark` attribute to `true` in the Controls Tab.
To properly see what a comonent looks like on dark backgrounds use the **Toggles** above the Canvas to **change the background color of the Canvas to dark**.

## Accessibility

HTW Berlin Web Components aim to meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ([WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)).
**Not all HTW brand color combinations meet the standards so when picking a color for your component keep its readability in mind.**

#### Automatic Accessibility Tests

Automatic Accessibility Test results based on [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) can be viewed below each component in the **Tab Accessibility**.

#### Vision Deficiency Emulation

In the Canvas Tab above each component you can **toggle on different Vision Deficienciy Emulations** to further test accessibility.

## User Testing

For user testing prior to a finished implementation a design tool is more suitable. See the [Design section](../?path=/story/design--page) to learn more.
